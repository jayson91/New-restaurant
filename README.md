CareerFoundry Project: Demonstrating Proficiency in Predicting Modeling
This project highlights my expertise in Python and Tableau, employing NumPy, Pandas and Skitlearn for comprehensive data analysis and effective data management. The dataset, sourced from CareerFoundry, revolves around the Zomato dataset taken from Kaggle.

---

## Objectives
It will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.

## Data

We were provided with datasets that contained all details of Bangalore restuarants.

- listed_in(type)                  
- listed_in(city)

## Folders

The basket analysis was separated into the following folders:

   - Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
   - Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. **NOTE: This folder is not included**
   - Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
   - Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
   - Sent to client: Contains the Final Report
